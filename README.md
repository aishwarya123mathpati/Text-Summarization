# Text Summarization with Frequency-Based Scoring

# Overview
This project implements a basic text summarization technique using frequency-based scoring. The goal is to extract the most important sentences from a given text, creating a concise summary while retaining the key points.

This approach is based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, leveraging word tokenization, stopword removal, and sentence scoring.

# Features
- Tokenizes input text into words and sentences.
- Filters out stopwords to focus on meaningful terms.
- Assigns scores to sentences based on word frequency.
- Generates a summary by selecting sentences with scores above a calculated threshold.
